 <h1 align="center"><b>E-Commerce Performance Report</b></h1>

 ## Client Background:
Nexwave is a U.S.-based e-commerce company selling consumer electronics and accessories across global markets. Founded in 2018, Nexwave scaled rapidly through its website and mobile platforms while navigating increased competition and pandemic-driven market shifts.
This project analyzes Nexwave’s performance from 2019–2022, covering 108,000+ transactions, ~88,000 customers, and $28M+ in revenue, to uncover trends in sales, customer behaviour, loyalty impact, refunds, channels, and regional performance.

## Business Problem: 
As Nexwave expanded its global e-commerce operations, leadership needed a clearer, data-driven understanding of business performance. While transactional data was available, it was not being leveraged effectively to evaluate sales trends, product performance, customer loyalty impact, refund behaviour, and regional growth.
This project aims to consolidate and analyze Nexwave’s data to answer key questions around revenue trends, customer value, operational efficiency, and growth opportunities, enabling stakeholders to make more informed strategic decisions.
