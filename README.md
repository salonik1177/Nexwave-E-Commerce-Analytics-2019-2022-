 <h1 align="center"><b>E-Commerce Performance Report</b></h1>

 ## Client Background:
Nexwave is a U.S.-based e-commerce company selling consumer electronics and accessories across global markets. Founded in 2018, Nexwave scaled rapidly through its website and mobile platforms while navigating increased competition and pandemic-driven market shifts.
This project analyzes Nexwave’s performance from 2019–2022, covering 108,000+ transactions, ~88,000 customers, and $28M+ in revenue, to uncover trends in sales, customer behaviour, loyalty impact, refunds, channels, and regional performance.

## Business Problem: 
As Nexwave expanded its global e-commerce operations, leadership needed a clearer, data-driven understanding of business performance. While transactional data was available, it was not being leveraged effectively to evaluate sales trends, product performance, customer loyalty impact, refund behaviour, and regional growth.
This project aims to consolidate and analyze Nexwave’s data to answer key questions around revenue trends, customer value, operational efficiency, and growth opportunities, enabling stakeholders to make more informed strategic decisions.

•	Nexwave’s sales surged sharply during the 2020 pandemic, peaking at $1.24M in December, before entering a prolonged decline through 2022. 

•	As shown in the chart above, the downturn was driven primarily by declining order volume rather than pricing, as Average Order Value (AOV) remained relatively stable post-pandemic.

•	Revenue is heavily concentrated in high-ticket products and the North American market, increasing sensitivity to demand shifts. While loyalty customers consistently outperform non-loyalty customers across revenue, AOV, and retention, they also exhibit higher refund rates. 

•	These findings point to clear opportunities to reignite demand, strengthen loyalty engagement, diversify acquisition channels, and expand regional growth.

## Data structure and ERD:  

The database contains four tables: Orders, Customers, Geo Lookup and Order status. The data spans the period from 2019 to 2022 and includes over 108,000 transactions.
